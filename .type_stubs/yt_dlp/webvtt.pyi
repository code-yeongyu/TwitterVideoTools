"""
A partial parser for WebVTT segments. Interprets enough of the WebVTT stream
to be able to assemble a single stand-alone subtitle file, suitably adjusting
timestamps on the way, while everything else is passed through unmodified.

Regular expressions based on the W3C WebVTT specification
<https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/>. The X-TIMESTAMP-MAP extension is described
in RFC 8216 ยง3.5 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216#section-3.5>.
